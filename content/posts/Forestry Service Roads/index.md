## 1 The Solution
A high-quality, user-friendly job aid that improves compliance through efficiency and reduction of errors in the operation of radios while traveling on forestry service roads.

{{< admonition success "Job Aid Document" true >}} 
The job aid document serves as a reference guide for employees to access critical information related to the operation of 2-way radios while traveling on Forestry Service Roads, this includes:
1. **step-by-step instructions** emphasizing technical details, specifically SOS emergency procedures
1. **diagrams** serve as a quick reference for operators 
1. **signage** explanations and critical takeaways


Additionally, a training course was constructed using **Articulate360 LMS** to enhance the user's understanding and evaluate retention of the information.

Structured authoring techniques ensured consistency in style and formatting, as well as to make the document more easily maintainable and adaptable for future updates.

## 2 The Problem

{{< admonition example "Constraints" true >}}
These constraints are due to the Energy Regulator's document management system and their tight integration of Microsoft Office products:
1. **MS Word** is the preferred publishing platform 
1. **MS Powerpoint** is the prefered image manipulation platform due its simplicity, availability, and compatibility
1. **No external libraries** including Acrobat, Office365, and stock images or graphical assets

## 3 The Process
