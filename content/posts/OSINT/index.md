## Introduction
Create a complete lesson package for the {{< link href="https://usay.ca" content="Urban Society for Aboriginal Youth (USAY)" >}} that complements the AR materials presented to users during the “Remembering Our Children” activity while using their {{< link href="https://usay.ca/indigitrails/" content="IndigiTRAiLS" >}} app.

This teaching and learning package is intended for students and teachers who wish to learn more after engaging with the app.
## Design Challenge
USAY has been approached by clients for additional resources to further the discovery and discussion prompted by engagement with the IndigiTRAILS app. Currently, no such materials are available for distribution to clients. USAY envisions a complete teaching and learning package that supplements the content presented in the IndigiTRAILS app.


The clients who engage USAY with the highest frequency of requests for supplemental learning material are comprised of grades 7-9 teachers and students. The trail on the IndigiTRAILS app that receives the greatest number of inquiries is that of “Remembering our Children,” which addresses the legacy of residential schools.


Given the positive response and affirmation of these requests from clients for material that furthers discussion and understanding of this subject, USAY seeks to provide a learning package for grade 7-9 students that facilitate further engagement in the classroom.

### Current Training
Beyond what is currently available on the IndigiTRAILS website, teachers and students do not have access to additional information directly from USAY that is related to the app content. They are aware of the topic of the app, which is provided by the website, but not of the installations nor the specific content presented in the app.

### Performance Gaps

There are two video links on the USAY website that instruct users on how to set up the app (i.e. enable location functionality, sound, etc.) and orient users to features of the app, such as the navigation experience and interactivity with the app.

Users can download a PDF visualization of the trail map as well as a page that describes the artists whose work is featured in the trail in question. Further instruction and discussion questions associated with the app experience are not available to users.

Outside of USAY, Alberta Education provides guidance, as part of “Education for Reconciliation,” in the form of online professional learning tools available to support teachers. These resources address understanding and ensuring accuracy, appropriateness, and authenticity in communicating Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing:
* {{< link "https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/fnmigv/index.html" "Guiding Voices" >}}: A Curriculum Development Tool for Inclusion of First Nations, Métis and Inuit Perspectives (Alberta Education)
* {{< link "https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/aswt/" "Walking Together" >}}: First Nations, Métis and Inuit Perspectives in Curriculum (Alberta Education)
* {{< link "https://www.teachers.ab.ca/professional-development/indigenous-education-and-walking-together" "Indigenous Education and Walking Together" >}} (Alberta Teachers’ Association)


Some resources provide guidance to teachers on the incorporation of Indigenous
perspectives and ways of knowing in their instruction:
* {{< link "https://empoweringthespirit.ca/" "Empowering the Spirit" >}} and {{< link "https://arpdcresources.ca/?s=indigenous" "Education Resources to Support Reconciliation" >}} (Alberta Regional Professional Development Consortia (ARPDC))


A search of the LearnAlberta site for resources that specifically address residential schools yielded twenty-four resources, and of these, thirteen are suitable for students in grades 7 to 9. These resources consist of short films, interviews, and documentaries about the trauma and hardships of survivors, and the lasting impacts on culture, language and identity.


These resources for teachers may not relate directly to the content and context provided by the IndigiTRAILS app, which may therefore be challenging for teachers to incorporate in-class as a continuation of the IndigiTRAILS experience.

{{< admonition warning "Project Constraints" true >}}

USAY indicates that the majority of requests for supplemental materials come from junior high school teachers (grades 7-9), with a particular focus on the “Remembering Our Children” trail. Some project constraints include:
- Material must be **age-appropriate**.
- Material must align with **Alberta Education curriculum**.
- Material must be **cost-effective** and free to download.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Goal Statement
Based on the needs of the primary and secondary clients (i.e. USAY and grades 7-9 teachers and students, respectively), we seek to create a learning package that consists of content and activities that complement the “Remembering our Children” trail which are suitable for use in the classroom for grades 7-9.

This package aims to support ongoing discussion and reflection, as part of the IndigiTRAILS app experience, without requiring prior knowledge nor significant instructional preparatory time on the part of teachers.

## Desired Outcomes
1. Provide USAY with a learning package that aligns with USAY’s values and supplements the content on the “Remembering our Children” trail of the IndigiTRALS app.
2. Foster engagement with and compel deeper understanding among grade 7-9 teachers and students of the history and legacy of residential schools.

## Design Precedents

Facing History: Stolen Lives
Facing History’s “Stolen Lives” program serves to guide participants and facilitators through the historic significance and legacy of destruction from Canada’s ‘Indian Residential Schools’. Activities serve to foster meaningful discussions which encourage students to reflect on these topics in the context of Canada’s history and their position in the world today (https://www.facinghistory.org/en-ca/resource-library/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-indian-residential-schools).

Suggested activities include: use of poetry to evoke insightful discussions about current events as they relate to the content, mock debates wherein students take a stance on a c ontroversial subject to garner meaningful inquiry and alternative perspectives, and a self-reflection activity which seeks to inspire students to explore their names, their languages, and the ways in which they benefit from these factors. For example, the activity entitled Big Paper explores silence as a tool to explore sensitive topics in depth through a collaborative sharing exercise (https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/big-paper-building-silent-conversation).

Additionally, Facing History offers teaching resources as chapters consisting of (1) a set of introductory “guiding questions”, (2) written materials for students to follow along with during each section of the corresponding lessons, and (3) a set of follow-up questions sought to elicit thoughtful discussion which explore the connection to Indigenous history, truth & reconciliation, student positionality and worldviews.

The National Centre for Collaboration of Indigenous Education (NCCIE)
NCCIE connects teachers with authentic resources to help infuse Indigenous knowledge, history, and ways of knowing in their lessons from an informed position with the consent of those involved. NCCIE offers a ‘Resource Library’ which features a searchable catalogue of all their offerings, sorted by topic, media, and area, along with their “Knowledge Space”, a collaborative interactive digital space for Indigenous voices and knowledge (https://www. nccie.ca/knowledge-space/).

NCCIE’s website offers a free “Teaching Resource Centre”, which explores lesson plans, skills, and materials to engage K-12 students in a combination of otherwise mainstream subjects, such as science and language arts, with a strong emphasis on demonstrating Indigenous-based approaches and understanding of social studies, art, history, and governance (https://www.nccie.ca/teaching-resource-centre).

Additionally, the “Lesson Plan Search” enables teachers to browse lesson templates and learning materials sorted by subject, grade, age group, province, and using key terms, for example: decolonization, reconciliation, and/or healing. Resources are available as videos, PDF, audio recordings and interactive web-based activities (https://www.nccie.ca/lesson-plan- search).
