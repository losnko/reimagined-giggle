## Activities

### Designed A Portfolio

I wrote this reflection as a blog post entitled {{< link "https://senkolo.xyz/going-hugo" "Going Hugo" >}} .

### Updated A Resume

I chose to create a {{< link "resume" " digital version" >}} of my resume, so it could live as a component in my new portfolio.

I made strategic use of the embedded table of contents to provide a summarized view of my resume for those readers who chose to quickly glance at the page before reading the full document.

{{< style "border: 1px solid black;" >}}
{{< image src="images/resumeSample.png" width="100%" height="100%" caption="Screenshot demonstrating that summarized view" >}}
{{< /style >}}

Additionally, the digital resume afforded me another opportunity to showcase myself in a unique light which may appeal to employers.

### Brand Development

I developed my branding and professional identity to reflect a more minimalist mindset. This included:
1. A colour-scheme
1. An icon/logo 
1. An avatar

However, after settling on the current monochromatic black and white colour-scheme, I chose to limit any *personal flair* to the featured 'hero' image which sits at the helm of each individual post.

This provides a dynamic and *optional* way to showcase myself through simple aesthetic charms without distracting from the materials on display, as graphic design is not the focus of my portfolio.

#### Design: Article Cards

The static components of the card include: typeface, type placement, nameplate shape and colour.
