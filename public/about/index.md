{{< admonition type=info title="Hi there!" >}}
My name is Logan Senko. <br>
I'm a recent communications graduate living in Calgary, AB.
* I enjoy solving technical challenges :(fas fa-lock fa-fw):
* I posses a keen eye for detail and aesthetics :(fas fa-lightbulb fa-fw):
* I contribute a unique blend of passion and inquiry :(fas fa-anchor fa-fw):

I combine the militant endurance of a seasoned chef with a hacker's desire to discover how *everything* works.
