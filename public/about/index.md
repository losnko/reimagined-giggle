My name is Logan Senko. <br>
I'm a recent communications graduate living in Calgary, AB.
* I enjoy **solving** technical challenges :(fas fa-lock fa-fw):
* I posses a **keen eye** for detail and aesthetics :(fas fa-lightbulb fa-fw):
* I contribute a unique blend of **passion and inquiry** :(fas fa-anchor fa-fw):

I combine the focus and endurance of a seasoned chef with a hacker's desire to uncover how *everything* works.
