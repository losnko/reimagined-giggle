## 1 Solution

{{< admonition success "Job Aid Documentation" true >}}
A high-quality, user-friendly job aid and reference guide to access critical information related to the operation of 2-way radios while traveling on Forestry Service Roads (FSRs).
<br>This includes:
1. **step-by-step instructions** emphasizing technical details, specifically SOS emergency procedures
1. **diagrams** serve as a quick reference for operators 
1. **signage** explanations and critical takeaways

Structured authoring techniques ensured consistency in style and formatting, which made the document easy to maintain and flexible for future updates.

## 2 Challenge

{{< admonition example "Constraints" true >}}
These constraints are due to the Energy Regulator's document management system and their tight integration of Microsoft Office products:
1. **MS Word** is the preferred publishing platform 
1. **MS Powerpoint** is the preferred image manipulation platform due its simplicity, availability, and compatibility
1. **No external libraries** including Acrobat, Office365, and stock images or graphical assets

## 3 Process
The job aid document required designing, organizing and presenting the content in a clear and intuitive manner. I chose to sort the information from an operational standpoint, which made use of existing logistical structures and maximized my ability to coordinate with SMEs who could answer my questions **and** test my prototypes.
