This post explores that journey. The information design program encouraged students to use Adobe’s Portfolio in preparation for their internships during their 2nd year of studies. It was time for a change. Goodbye, Adobe While the decision to use Adobe’s portfolio has many advantages, it comes with a few significant drawbacks: Price tag is the major deterrent, specifically the push to an annual subscription model. Formulaic offerings which look great but offer little in terms of customizability. Uninspired user experience that offers tedious formatting options and leaves me frustrated. For the price, I find Adobe’s offering to be prohibitively restrictive while simultaneously including far more than my work requires.

Beyond its blazing fast performance, I chose Hugo because it offers: Headless CMS allows me to write entries in plain text instead of within Adobe’s content management system.
