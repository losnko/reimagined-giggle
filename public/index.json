A key participant in this process are the Indigneous Monitors (IM): Quote Indigenous peoples, the Government of Canada, and the CER worked together to create the Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committees, or IAMCs. These IAMCs operate independently to increase Indigenous involvement in the federal monitoring and oversight of energy-related projects. The Committees provide the opportunity for Indigenous peoples to participate meaningfully in oversight activities along the pipeline corridor while companies do work to build and operate the projects. Indigenous monitors participate in regulatory work, including:  On-site inspection  Evaluation and training  Emergency response  Compliance verification ","date":"2023-02-05","objectID":"/pipeline-operations/:2:2","tags":null,"title":"Pipeline Compliance \u0026 Documentation","uri":"/pipeline-operations/"},{"categories":["Technical Writing"],"content":"Existing Materials The inspection process consists of 4 phases which correspond to the on-site workflows. Each project has a corresponding pair of inspection and workflow job aid documents to reference during an inspection. Constraints The federal regulator’s document management system is tightly integrated to their use of Microsoft Office \u0026 Teams. These constraints are the result of that integration: MS Powerpoint is the prefered platform due its simplicity, availability, and compatability with most images and files No external libraries including Acrobat, Office365, and stock images or graphics Mobile friendly Ipad mini is primary viewing device. The CER \u0026 IM inspection serves as the primary report for compliance, activites and conditions concerning the four major extraction projects: TMX, NGTL, Line3, and KXL.
