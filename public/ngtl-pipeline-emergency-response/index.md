# Pipeline Compliance & Documentation

## 1 Overview

### Background 

The {{< link href="https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/index.html" content="Canada Energy Regulator (CER)" >}} works to protect the future of the Canadian energy industry by developing projects which engage with Indigenous communities to ensure energy projects operate safely and under the strictest environmental standards.

A key participant in this process are the **Indigneous Monitors (IM)**:

{{< admonition type="quote" >}} Indigenous peoples, the Government of Canada, and the CER worked together to create the Indigenous Advisory and Monitoring Committees, or IAMCs. These IAMCs operate independently to increase Indigenous involvement in the federal monitoring and oversight of energy-related projects. The Committees provide the opportunity for Indigenous peoples to participate meaningfully in oversight activities along the pipeline corridor while companies do work to build and operate the projects. {{< /admonition >}}

Indigenous monitors participate in regulatory work, including:

* :(fas fa-search fa-fw): On-site inspection
* :(fas fa-pencil fa-fw): Evaluation and training
* :(fas fa-ambulance fa-fw): Emergency response
* :(fas fa-check-circle fa-fw): Compliance verification

### Existing Materials

The inspection process consists of 4 phases which correspond to the on-site workflows. Each project has a corresponding pair of inspection and workflow job aid documents to reference during an inspection. <br> <br> The CER & IM inspection serves as the primary report for compliance, activites and conditions concerning the four major extraction projects :(fas fa-industry fa-fw): : TMX, NGTL, Line3, and KXL.

## 2 Analysis


{{< admonition failure "Initial impression" true >}} Materials exists as **nine** separate documents:
1. Resource intensive to maintain
1. Prone to inconsistent revisioning
1. Lacks meaningful method for version control
1. Accessibility, contrast and colour
